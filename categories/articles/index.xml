&lt;p>Some weeks ago while studying about CSS, I stumbled upon &lt;a href="https://houdini.how">https://houdini.how&lt;/a> and it seems as a fun feature to experiment and integrate in your projects in the
future.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#what-is-it">ðŸ”—&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>


&lt;p>The same way HTML has the DOM, CSS has the CSS Object Model (CSSOM) and the CSS Houdini group are developing APIs that are meant to allow developers to make use
of it in the form of Worklets, these can be reusable and shared between projects. It&amp;rsquo;s basically a way to allow developers to not wait for a browser standard
and instead develop their own little features.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A comparison of FOSS Android keyboards</title><link>https://1hiking.github.io/posts/2021/06/a-comparison-of-foss-android-keyboards/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://1hiking.github.io/posts/2021/06/a-comparison-of-foss-android-keyboards/</guid><description>&lt;details>

 &lt;li>&lt;a href="#anysoftkeyboard">AnySoftKeyboard&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>&lt;a href="#florisboard">FlorisBoard&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>&lt;a href="#openboard">OpenBoard&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>&lt;a href="#conclusions">Conclusions&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
 &lt;/ul>
&lt;/nav>
&lt;/details>

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s common for many Android enthusiasts to customize their devices and while
Swiftkey and GBoard are good alternatives, the companies behind them don&amp;rsquo;t have
a good privacy record , this turns many people for other alternatives, many
which are found in the Play-Store and F-droid repositories, I will compare them
and give my opinion over which one is &amp;ldquo;the best&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="anysoftkeyboard">AnySoftKeyboard
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#anysoftkeyboard">ðŸ”—&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>


&lt;p>This one is the most &amp;ldquo;feature-full&amp;rdquo; of all the ones I have found, since it&amp;rsquo;s the
most customizable&amp;hellip; at least for now&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>First post</title><link>https://1hiking.github.io/posts/2021/04/first-post/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://1hiking.github.io/posts/2021/04/first-post/</guid><description>&lt;p>So after many time I finally decided to start using a static site generator,
specifically Hugo. In general I believe this will help me make my content more
easy and I will not have to screw around all day with html and css, not because
I hate it but because it&amp;rsquo;s very tiresome the copypaste.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another thing to note is that before choosing Hugo I tried JBake and Jekyll, I
enjoyed the first hours of JBake not before realizing the lack of public themes
to choose from&amp;hellip; and with Jekyll it was a pain to install on Wingblows and I
don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy having to setup Cywing or having to use WSL.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
