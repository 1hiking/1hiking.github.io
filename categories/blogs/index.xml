In general I believe this will help me make my content more easy and I will not have to screw around all day with html and css, not because I hate it but because it&amp;rsquo;s very tiresome the copypaste.
Another thing to note is that before choosing Hugo I tried JBake and Jekyll, I enjoyed the first hours of JBake not before realizing the lack of public themes to choose from&amp;hellip; and with Jekyll it was a pain to install on Wingblows and I don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy having to setup Cywing or having to use WSL.</description></item></channel></rss>
