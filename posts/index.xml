Deprecated settings New telemetry settings Settings you might want to check Wrapping it up In contrast to some popular beliefs, it is possible to make VS Code a very private code editor without the need of using forks such as VSCodium.
Deprecated settings ðŸ”— The settings &amp;quot;telemetry.enableCrashReporter&amp;quot;: false and &amp;quot;telemetry.enableTelemetry&amp;quot;: false are deprecated and useless.

(and anyone really).
One of the key aspects over the change were some features I didn&amp;rsquo;t have in the last one, for example, a Table of Contents or an automatic nav and instead had other features that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t using and added size to the page such as Google Analytics.</description></item><item><title>Matrix Stickers</title><link>https://1hiking.github.io/posts/2021/09/matrix-stickers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://1hiking.github.io/posts/2021/09/matrix-stickers/</guid><description>Table of Contents
The m.room.message &amp;ldquo;hack&amp;rdquo; The real method: m.sticker Implementation examples The Future of Stickers You possibly don&amp;rsquo;t know matrix stickers. e I have collected over these past few months some JSON&amp;rsquo;s, curiously I have found 2 types of &amp;ldquo;stickers&amp;rdquo;, so I will share and discuss them. Moreover I will also explain how some clients implement stickers.
Let&amp;rsquo;s open the dev console!
The m.room.message &amp;ldquo;hack&amp;rdquo; ðŸ”— This type of sticker is more of a inline message, you probably have seen this variant if a room has a discord bridge bot and users in the Discord room post custom emojis.</description></item><item><title>The Freedom Phone OEM problems</title><link>https://1hiking.github.io/posts/2021/08/the-freedom-phone-oem-problems/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://1hiking.github.io/posts/2021/08/the-freedom-phone-oem-problems/</guid><description>Table of Contents
The problem What do I use for privacy and security? As we all know, some months ago it came out the highly ridiculed &amp;ldquo;Freedom Phone&amp;rdquo;, with very suspicious claims like having an &amp;ldquo;Uncensorable App Store&amp;rdquo; which is actually just a rebranded Aurora Store or the claim that the OS is a blend of AOSP, LineageOS and GrapheneOS (What did he mean by this?)</description></item><item><title>Matrix 101 for your friends</title><link>https://1hiking.github.io/posts/2021/07/matrix-101-for-your-friends/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://1hiking.github.io/posts/2021/07/matrix-101-for-your-friends/</guid><description>Table of Contents

Read the official FAQ In recent years the Matrix protocol, messaging service, decentralised conversation store or whatever you want to call it has been gaining a lot of traction as a replacement in many communities for many reasons, it might be because IRC isn&amp;rsquo;t cutting it or you are using a service which doesn&amp;rsquo;t respect your privacy or has horrible security.</description></item><item><title>A comparison of FOSS Android keyboards</title><link>https://1hiking.github.io/posts/2021/06/a-comparison-of-foss-android-keyboards/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://1hiking.github.io/posts/2021/06/a-comparison-of-foss-android-keyboards/</guid><description>Table of Contents
AnySoftKeyboard FlorisBoard OpenBoard aaaaa Conclusions It&amp;rsquo;s common for many Android enthusiasts to customize their devices and while Swiftkey and GBoard are good alternatives, the companies behind them don&amp;rsquo;t have a good privacy record , this turns many people for other alternatives, many which are found in the Play-Store and F-droid repositories, I will compare them and give my opinion over which one is &amp;ldquo;the best&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Making a browser from Scratch!</title><link>https://1hiking.github.io/posts/2021/04/making-a-browser-from-scratch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://1hiking.github.io/posts/2021/04/making-a-browser-from-scratch/</guid><description>Table of Contents
Introduction Requirements Conclusions Inspired by Introduction ðŸ”— So let&amp;rsquo;s talk about developing a browser, one of the most complex programs in your computer!
As most people know, since the 90&amp;rsquo;s web browsers have been an essential program in anyone&amp;rsquo;s computer, they allow you to connect with your friends online, play videogames, read scientific papers, or even niche functions to connect to FTP&amp;hellip;! oh actually nevermind.</description></item><item><title>First post</title><link>https://1hiking.github.io/posts/2021/04/first-post/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://1hiking.github.io/posts/2021/04/first-post/</guid><description>So after many time I finally decided to start using a static site generator, specifically Hugo. In general I believe this will help me make my content more easy and I will not have to screw around all day with html and css, not because I hate it but because it&amp;rsquo;s very tiresome the copypaste.
Another thing to note is that before choosing Hugo I tried JBake and Jekyll, I enjoyed the first hours of JBake not before realizing the lack of public themes to choose from&amp;hellip; and with Jekyll it was a pain to install on Wingblows and I don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy having to setup Cywing or having to use WSL.</description></item></channel></rss>
