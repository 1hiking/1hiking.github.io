If your language is not in the repo, then pick something else. I also cannot find documentation for making new layouts :/.</p></li></ul><p>As a note: on F-droid their name and icon every few days, I don&rsquo;t know if this is to blame on the F-droid build services or in the ASK metadata.</p><p>Link: <a href=https://f-droid.org/es/packages/com.menny.android.anysoftkeyboard>https://f-droid.org/es/packages/com.menny.android.anysoftkeyboard</a></p><p><br></br></p><ol start=2><li>FlorisBoard <img src=/posts/FlorisBoard.png alt="FlorisBoard logo"></li></ol><p>As of posting this article, I believe FlorisBoard is the most youngest alternative out there in F-droid, and it really looks like a good alternative for those who can&rsquo;t or don&rsquo;t like to use ASK.</p><ul><li><p>It contains their own clipboard which is pretty nice since some phones don&rsquo;t allow you to see the clipboard.</p></li><li><p>There are 8 themes: 3 day themes and 5 dark themes, and they all look good.</p></li><li><p>There is also a glide typing and gestures. I think Floris has better gestures than ASK but I might
be a little biased.</p></li></ul><p>Many features present in ASK will be here too, one of them being adaptative themes. Floris also has a better configuration app and other tiny good details, I think I will start recommending it once it leaves beta :).</p><p>Link: <a href=https://f-droid.org/es/packages/dev.patrickgold.florisboard/>https://f-droid.org/es/packages/dev.patrickgold.florisboard/</a></p><p><br></br></p><ol start=3><li>OpenBoard <img src=/posts/OpenBoard.png alt="OpenBoard logo"></li></ol><p>This is my mainly drive, at difference of ASK and FlorisBoard this one is very minimal. Some people compare the layout and design to GBoard too.</p><ul><li><p>Configuration app is very &ldquo;minimal&rdquo;, in 3 panels you will change everything you need.</p></li><li><p>No gestures, no glide typing&mldr; so forget about that.</p></li><li><p>All themes are based on Material and they are very similar and very good. There is also 2 Holo themes if you like 2010&rsquo;s style&mldr;</p></li><li><p>In general the presets are good enough, I have never experienced a lag or crash unlike others (FlorisBoard pleaseee&mldr;)</p></li></ul><p>Link: <a href=https://f-droid.org/es/packages/org.dslul.openboard.inputmethod.latin/>https://f-droid.org/es/packages/org.dslul.openboard.inputmethod.latin/</a></p><p><br></br></p><ol start=4><li>aaaaa <img src=/posts/aaaa.png alt="aaaa logo"></li></ol><p>aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</p><p>Link: <a href=https://f-droid.org/es/packages/io.github.dkter.aaaaa/>https://f-droid.org/es/packages/io.github.dkter.aaaaa/</a></p><p><br></br>Who won?<br></br>aaaa, good night</p></article><section class="article labels"><a class=category href=/categories/articles/>Articles</a><a class=tag href=/tags/f-droid/>F-droid</a><a class=tag href=/tags/android/>Android</a><a class=tag href=/tags/keyboards/>Keyboards</a></section><section class="article license"><a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/><img alt=Creative commons license style=border-width:0 src=https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/4.0/88x31.png></a><br>This work is licensed under a <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/>Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>.</section><section class="article author"><div class=details><a class=item href=https://github.com/1hiking target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="iconfont icon-github"></span>&nbsp;1hiking</a></div></section></div><div class="article bottom"><section class="article navigation"><p><a class=link href=/2021/04/making-a-browser-from-scratch/><span class="iconfont icon-article"></span>Making a browser from Scratch!</a></p></section></div></section><section id=footer><div class=footer-wrap><p class=copyright>Hiking's webpage</p><p class=powerby><span>Powered&nbsp;by&nbsp;</span><a href=https://gohugo.io target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Hugo</a><span>&nbsp;&&nbsp;</span><a href=https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-notepadium/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Notepadium</a></p></div></section></body></html>
