## Greetings

I am a privacy and security enthusiast, I have contributed to community projects
such as Weblate and OSM on my spare time. I am also a student.

Some outstanding programs I use are:

- [Winget](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/) as
  my Windows "package" manager.
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) as my code editor.
- [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) as my IDE for Java.
- [MS Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge) as my browser (which I despise).

You might find me on Matrix channels.
