So after many time I finally decided to start using a static site generator, specifically Hugo.
In general I believe this will help me make my content more easy and I will not have to
screw around all day with html and css, not because I hate it but because it's very tiresome the
copypaste.

Another thing to note is that before choosing Hugo I tried JBake and Jekyll, I enjoyed the first hours of JBake not before realizing the lack of public themes to choose from... and with Jekyll it was a pain to install on Wingblows and I don't enjoy having to setup Cywing or having to use WSL.

And before leaving my old repository to rest... shotouts to [Jaafar](https://jaafard.codeberg.page/) for letting me copy some of the project files made for his webpage.
