## Introduction

So let's talk about developing a browser, one of the most complex programs in
your computer!

As most people know, since the 90's web browsers have been an essential program
in anyone's computer, they allow you to connect with your friends online, play
videogames, read scientific papers, or even niche functions to connect to
FTP...! oh actually nevermind.

Well with that quick recap, I will teach you how to make your own browser from
scratch!

## Requirements

- Install latest Electron release on
  [here](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases).

- Have a computer, buy one in your nearest Walmart :).

- An Operating System, the choice is yours!.

## Conclusions

Making a web browser was a real challenge, after all
[you need to support all of the Web standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_standards)
:) and that's soooo tiresome! Well I hope you guys have a good time, goodbye and
until our next blog!
