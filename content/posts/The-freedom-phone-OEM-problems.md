As we all know, some months ago it came out the highly ridiculed "Freedom
Phone", with very suspicious claims like having an "Uncensorable App Store"
which is actually just a rebranded
[Aurora Store](https://auroraoss.com/download/AuroraStore/) or the claim that
the OS is a blend of AOSP, LineageOS and GrapheneOS (_What did he mean by
this?_)

But one of the things that came to my attention was the hardware... wich
according to this
[article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/maga-worlds-freedom-phone-actually-budget-chinese-phone)
it's an Umidigi phone, at first I said just laughed, but then... I laughed even
more.

## The problem

Okay, so if you don't own an Umidigi phone or know somebody who owns one you
will likely never hear about this, but Umidigi phones are incredibly buggy in
regards to updates.

I have a known familiar that one day after attempting to update his device just
got a
[dm-verity error](https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot/boot-flow#dm-verity-corruption),
if you don't believe me, here is a
[Reddit post showing it off](https://web.archive.org/web/20210807204933/https://www.reddit.com/r/umidigi/comments/ofg6ib/a9_pro_6gb128gb_phone_corrupted_after_umidigi/)

Even more laughable was the response they gave according to another redditor in
that same post:

This is horrible, consider that your average Jimmy is not going to know how to
flash his ROM or have the ability to recognize his exact model variant, so
yeah... the Umidigi phones are hot garbage, and so is the Freedom Phone, hey a
perfect match!

But if I'm honest these phones probably will never receive updates of any type
so I guess they are safe _from this problem_.

## What do I use for privacy and security?

Get a modern Pixel phone and flash [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/), their
developers are competent and so is their manufacturer when it comes to security.
