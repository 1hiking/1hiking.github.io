It's common for many Android enthusiasts to customize their devices and while Swiftkey and  GBoard are good alternatives, the companies behind them don't have a good privacy record , this turns many people for other alternatives, many which are found in the Play-Store and F-droid repositories, I will compare them and give my opinion over which one is "the best".

1. AnySoftKeyboard ![AnySoftKeyboard logo](/posts/fosskeybaords/AnySoftKeyboard.png)

    This one is the most "feature-full" of all the ones I have found, since it's the most customizable... at least for now...

    * You can change the bottom and top row based on a list of pre-sets.

    * There are over 17 skins loaded, however some of them are very meh... looking at you "Plain light" theme, and others are just slight modifications.

    * It also has glide typing which has been on beta for quite a while and I would say it's better than Floris right now, there is also gestures and they have good choices.

    * One dislike I have over this Keyboard is that if you want a new language package, you have to install an "app" instead of using the System language configuration for this.
    If your language is not in the repo, then pick something else. I also cannot find documentation for making new layouts :/.

    As a note: on F-droid their name and icon every few days, I don't know if this is to blame on the F-droid build services or in the ASK metadata.

2. FlorisBoard ![FlorisBoard logo](/posts/fosskeyboards/FlorisBoard.png)

    As of posting this article, I believe FlorisBoard is the most youngest alternative out there in F-droid, and it really looks like a good alternative for those who can't or don't like to use ASK.

    * It contains their own clipboard which is pretty nice since some phones don't allow you to see the clipboard.

    * There are 8 themes: 3 day themes and 5 dark themes, and they all look good.

    * There is also a glide typing and gestures. I think Floris has better gestures than ASK but I might
    be a little biased.

    Many features present in ASK will be here too, one of them being adaptative themes. Floris also has a better configuration app and other tiny good details, I think I will start recommending it once it leaves beta :).

3. OpenBoard ![OpenBoard logo](/posts/fosskeyboards/OpenBoard.png)

    This is my mainly drive, at difference of ASK and FlorisBoard this one is very minimal. Some people compare the layout and design to GBoard too.

    * Configuration app is very "minimal", in 3 panels you will change everything you need.

    * No gestures, no glide typing... so forget about that.

    * All themes are based on Material and they are very similar and very good. There is also 2 Holo themes if you like 2010's style...

    * In general the presets are good enough, I have never experienced a lag or crash unlike others (FlorisBoard pleaseee...)
