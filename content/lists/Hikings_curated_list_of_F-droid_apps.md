A curated list of some worth checking applications in the F-droid repo (and others too), short descriptions and notes are listed below.

This list is low-maintainance mode, since the purpose of this list is to give you a taste of high-quality programs... I believe there is a problem in F-droid in how they index and promote content in the front page, making harder for the user to find anything useful for their needs. Luckily [they are working on this](https://f-droid.org/en/2021/03/01/fdroid-metrics-and-clean-insights.html).

Consider that some programs that are not here (like [Vanadium](https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium)) will not be listed, yet they are still recomendable.
