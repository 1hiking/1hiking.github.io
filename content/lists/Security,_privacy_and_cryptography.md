This page collects many URLs which write about various topics about security, privacy, cryptography, etc, or in the same way I do, collect more websites to validate their arguments for or against a technology or an ideology. I have **no affiliation** with none of these sites and I just maintain it for my own pleasure.

Consider making a threat model that fits your needs and not randomly copypasting configuration settings or installing programs for the sake of it. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_theater> .

Please don't randomly post these links to try and win an argument war (~~like I do huehuehehehuehe~~), read the articles and make **your own conclusions**.
