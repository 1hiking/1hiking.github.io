## Browsers

1. [Fennec F-Droid](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix) 

> Browser that supports current and anticipated web standards.

2. [Bromite](https://github.com/bromite/bromite)  

> Bromite is a Chromium fork with ad blocking and enhanced privacy; take back your browser.

Notes:

* Custom repo is [required](https://fdroid.bromite.org/fdroid/repo).

3. [Privacy Browser](https://git.stoutner.com/?p=PrivacyBrowser.git;a=summary) 

> A web browser that respects your privacy.

Notes:

* Uses WebView as their rendering engine, so you have to keep that up-to-date.

4. [Tor Browser](https://github.com/guardianproject/tor-android) 

> Experience real private browsing without tracking, surveillance, or censorship.

Notes:

* Custom repo is [required](https://guardianproject.info/fdroid/), however F-droid has that repository added by default.

## File managers

1. [Simple File Manager](https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/Simple-File-Manager) 

> A simple file manager for browsing and editing files and directories.

* Part of "*Simple Tools*" collection, might wanna check more of [their programs here](https://www.simplemobiletools.com/).

2. [Material Files](https://github.com/zhanghai/MaterialFiles) 

> Open source Material Design file manager.

3. [Amaze](https://github.com/TeamAmaze/AmazeFileManager)

> Removes exif data and modifies images to reduce size before sharing.

2. [Scrambled Exif](https://gitlab.com/juanitobananas/scrambled-exif/tree/HEAD)

## Music players

1. [Vanilla Music](https://github.com/vanilla-music/vanilla) 

> Listen to and manage songs.

Notes:

* You could technically use Video Players (or any program that can process .mp3 files) as Music players.

## Video players

## F-droid clients

1. [F-Droid](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient) 

> The app store that respects freedom and privacy.
