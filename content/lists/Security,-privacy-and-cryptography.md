{{< toc >}}

This page collects many URLs which write about various topics about security,
privacy, cryptography, etc, or in the same way I do, collect more websites to
validate their arguments for or against a technology or an ideology. I have **no
affiliation** with none of these sites and I just maintain it for my own
pleasure.

Consider making a threat model that fits your needs and not randomly copypasting
configuration settings or installing programs for the sake of it, some of which
could be considered
[security theater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_theater)

Please don't randomly post these links to try and win an argument war (~~like I
do huehuehehehuehe~~), read the articles and make **your own conclusions**.
