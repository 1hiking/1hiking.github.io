Privacy enthusiast.

I contribute to Weblate.

Some outstanding programs I use are:

* Scoop as my Windows package manager. 
* VSCodium as my code editor.
* IntelliJ as my IDE for Java.
* Firefox Nightly/ Ungoogled-Chromium as my browsers.
* and... nothing more.


You might find me on Matrix channels.
